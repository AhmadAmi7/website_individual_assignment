<p>The moment and experience that open my eyes and i will never forget is i was traveled to many countries after i finished my studies in Diploma Business Studies. I had a lot of memories during the journey to Australia and Korea. All countries have different culture and manners such Australian eat with spoon and fork while Korean eat with chopstick and spoon. The difficulties when im travel both countries is Islamphobia and not welcoming muslim foreigners. But not all of them were act the same, some people welcoming muslims foreigner. In Korean, most of them cannot speak in english. Luckily my sister fluence to speak in Korea. In Australia, their pronounciation is different from others english langguages country.
